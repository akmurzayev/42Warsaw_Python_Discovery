# 42 Warsaw – Discovery Piscine: Introduction to Python (2025)

This repository contains my work from the **42 Warsaw Python Discovery Piscine**, a 40-hour intensive bootcamp focused on Python fundamentals and problem-solving through the 42 peer-learning methodology.

## 🧠 What I Learned
During the program, I practiced and applied:

### ✔ Python Fundamentals
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Parameter handling with `sys.argv`
- Input/output and basic string operations

### ✔ Lists & Array Manipulation
- Iteration and filtering
- Slicing, indexing, and transformations
- Removing duplicates using `set()`
- Generating ranges and converting them into lists

### ✔ Strings
- `upper()`, `lower()`, `find()`
- Character scanning
- Treating strings as arrays (index operations)
- Basic regex with `re.findall()`

### ✔ Custom Methods & Scope
- Creating Python functions (`def`)
- Default arguments
- Type checking with `isinstance()`
- Understanding variable scope inside methods

### ✔ Problem-Solving & Peer Learning
The Piscine heavily emphasizes:
- Working independently  
- Asking peers for help  
- Explaining your code  
- Reviewing others’ work (peer evaluation)
